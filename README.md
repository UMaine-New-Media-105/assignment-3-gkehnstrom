For A3Q1 we were tasked to create our catcher for the game we are going to be working on throughout the next couple weeks. for my game I decided to do a 
fish bowl and have the fight drop from the sky and you will have to move the bowl to catch them. I used two ellpises one for the actual bowl and one for
the base to make it more realilistic, we had to keep out catchers 50x50 pixels becuase our canvas can only be 400x400.

For A3Q2 we had to make a function such as mouse is pressed, to change somthing about out catcher, so I decided to make the base of my fishbowl change from
dark red to dark blue, we also had to make the our catcher follow our mouse back and fourth across the screen while staying on the same X axis, I also added
a background and a landscape so it looked like the fish bowl wasnt just floating.

For A3Q3 we were tasked to add a sprite that represents our seed which in my case would be a fish, So i created a fish out of an ellipse and a traingle to 
make a simple yellow fish. we then had to make the fish drop from the sky when you click your mouse button at different speeds and making sure it would 
spawn randomly in the sky each time. we also had to make sure once it hit the landscape/ ground that I added previously the fish would disappear.

For A3Q4 I made it so that when i moved my fish bowl under the fish and it landed in it, the bowl would change colors and the fish would disappear.
